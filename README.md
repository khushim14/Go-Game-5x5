# Go Game AI â€“ 5x5 Board

ðŸŽ¯ **Goal**: Implement a playable 5x5 Go game AI using Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning and Heuristics.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Handles basic Go rules (liberties, suicide, KO)
- 5x5 board with custom scoring heuristics
- Uses iterative deepening + alpha-beta pruning
- Evaluates board state with territory, liberties, and position
- Supports `PASS` move

---

## ðŸ§  AI Strategy

- Minimax search with a depth of 4
- Transposition table for efficiency
- Evaluation includes:
  - Number of stones
  - Liberty count
  - Territory estimation
  - Group penalty
  - Positional bonus (center/edge/corner)

## ðŸ§ª How to Run

1. Place your `input.txt` file in the directory. Format:

    ```
    2
    00000
    00000
    00000
    00000
    00000
    00000
    00000
    00000
    00000
    00010
    ```

    - Line 1: `1` or `2` â†’ Player color (Black=1, White=2)
    - Lines 2â€“6: Previous board state
    - Lines 7â€“11: Current board state

2. Run the game:
    ```bash
    python code.py
    ```

3. Move is written to `output.txt` in format: `i,j` or `PASS`

## ðŸ“‚ Files

- `code.py`: Main agent that plays Go using Minimax + Alpha-Beta pruning
- `input.txt`: Input file with player color, previous and current board state
- `output.txt`: Output file containing the move made by the agent
